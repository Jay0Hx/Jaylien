<h1 align="center">What is 'PredatorV1'?:</a></h1>
(CSP v0.1.79 ONLY)

Predator V1 is a new version of Alien2 (Linked above) which was an amazing tool for manipulating AC physics related features such as power, handling, grip, etc... CSP developers removed the usage of certain aspects which temporarily disabled the use of AlienV2. PredatorV1 is the new project filling the shoes of the previous developer, the latest version is tried and tested to be working on 0.1.79 and below which is currently the latest stable release of CSP.
