<h1 align="center">Information</a></h1>

***NOTE:*** This is a new and working version of my archived AlienV2 menu. DO NOT BUY THIS FROM ANYONE. I have noticed people are trying to sell the old verion that is no longer working, please don't fall for the scam, the code is FREE to use and edit by anyone, this is open source! AlienV2 was originally made by 'itisluiz'. I took this source code and added teleportation, engine manipulation pre-sets and more. That version no longer works hense I am making this new version.

<h1 align="center">Features </a></h1>  

***'Drivers Menu:***  
This menu is mainly used from a development standpoint, i use it to hide certain features that are either un-tested, glitchy or not working. This menu also includes the ability to disable certain features that you might not use or want to see. For example, if you don't have any use for the 'Drivers' menu, you are able to hide it using the relevant option in the settings menu.

<h1 align="center">Changes that I made</a></h1>

+ Added '*Flash Map*' options (This is a new tab that introduces 'maps' with pre-defined vaules for power etc...)  
+ I've compiled some things like power and handling under the same menu for easier use.     
+ There is now a 'Drivers' tab that allows you to teleport to people around the track or spectate them!
