***NOTE:*** This is a new and working version of my archived version of the AlienV2 menu, originally created by 'itisluiz'. DO NOT BUY THIS FROM ANYONE IT IS FREE TO USE. I have noticed people are trying to sell the old verion that is no longer working, please don't fall for the scam, the code is FREE to use and edit by anyone, this is open source! AlienV2 was originally made by 'itisluiz'. I took this source code and added teleportation, engine manipulation pre-sets and more. That version no longer works hense I am making this new version.

<h1 align="center">Features </a></h1>  

***- 'Drivers' Menu:***  
This menu is a live view of every connected driver in your current server that will display loads of usefull information with the added ability to spectate the driver. Currently this menu is slighly buggy and won't update correctly when drivers leave and rejoin multiple times, it seems to duplicate the entry for that driver?

<h1 align="center">Changes that I made</a></h1>

+ Added '*Flash Map*' options (This is a new tab that introduces 'maps' with pre-defined vaules for power etc...)  
+ I've compiled some things like power and handling under the same menu for easier use.     
+ There is now a 'Drivers' tab that allows you to teleport to people around the track or spectate them!

<h1 align="center">Installation Guide</a></h1> 

   ```sh

   2️⃣ > Navigate to your asseto corsa install location!
          ∟ Usuall ('C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\assettocorsa')
   3️⃣ > Open the 'Apps' directory, then 'lua' directory.
   4️⃣ > Drag PredatorV1-main into the lua file.
   5️⃣ > Remove main from the file name. (PredatorV1 Should be the file name!)

   And you are done!
   
   To use this menu just go in game, hover your mouse over the right side of the screen to reveal the menu toggle
   panel and select 'Alien V2.1(1)'.

+ Your final file structure should look something like this. You can ignore the Test files they are placeholders.
