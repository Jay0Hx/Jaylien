<h1 align="center">❓Information❓</a></h1>

***NOTE:*** This is a new and working version of my archived AlienV2 menu. DO NOT BUY THIS FROM ANYONE. I have noticed people are trying to sell the old verion that is no longer working, please don't fall for the scam, the code is FREE to use and edit by anyone, this is open source! AlienV2 was originally made by 'itisluiz'. I took this source code and added teleportation, engine manipulation pre-sets and more. That version no longer works hense I am making this new version.

<h1 align="center">Features </a></h1>  

***'Drivers' Menu:***  
This menu is a live view of every connected driver in your current server that will display loads of usefull information with the added ability to spectate the driver.

<h1 align="center">Changes that I made</a></h1>

+ Added '*Flash Map*' options (This is a new tab that introduces 'maps' with pre-defined vaules for power etc...)  
+ I've compiled some things like power and handling under the same menu for easier use.     
+ There is now a 'Drivers' tab that allows you to teleport to people around the track or spectate them!
